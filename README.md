Assumptions/Design Decisions made :-

I have experience in creating and developing power-packed and dynamic dashboards with real-time data containing seamless UI. Every design such as Card, button, dropdow,input, table, shape or any layout has been carved in my mind first and then I implemented it in the code. Colors choices might be not so good but I gave colors keeping modern UI/UX development in my mind. Thanks for reviewing the code!

Notes :- 

This project uses a mock API, so changes like add/edit/delete may not persist permanently.

The UI is optimized for clarity, usability, and responsiveness.

Designed keeping real-world dashboard use cases in mind.
